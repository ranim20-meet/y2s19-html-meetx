	<h2>Yes, it's a language</h2>
	<div class = 'content' style = "width:50%;">
		<p>American Sogn Language is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the US and most of Anglophone Canada.
		It originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in West Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations.</p>
